I specialize in 3d modeling, website building, and more! I am currently learning as much as I can about html & css. This is my first repository/project on github!

In this blog I will mostly ramble and cry and scream about really dumb things. I will also be talking a *lot* about my life and in general, dark and complicated subjects. If you'd like a bit more of a carefree and normal blog, take a look at my bearblog that's linked above.

I will link a portfolio & contact soon when I am able to!
