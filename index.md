My name is Lain, I specialize in 3d modeling, website building, and more! I am currently learning as much as I can about html & css. I started using github a week ago.

In this blog I will ramble about my code & 3d stuff. If you want my normal not-nerdy rambles, head over to my bearblog!

I will link a portfolio & contact soon when I am able to.
