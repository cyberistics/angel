# my new, updated website!

drastically different from my old one. Featuring:

- some art of my main sona, recolored + designed after my oldest oc
- includes a small portfolio
- a working mini guestbook, fueled by JavaScript
- a neocities/nekoweb style with several columns and images
- 
my code is quite awful... I know. There's a lot of cleaning I have to do as I left some things unused (╯︵╰,)

but im quite proud of this. I went from barely knowing any HTML, CSS, or JS earlier this year to making a really nice looking website. woo woo!
