pretty much im just asking for everyone to use she/her on me from now on. please, for my own safety.

Okay! back at a library computer with 15 minutes. Oh boy. 

So my mom's probably going to find my socials and this blog inevitably. Which is why I plan to change this entire post in a week or two along with a few other ones.

she's a whole lot better from years ago and much more loving, but she's still never going to accept me for who I am unfortunately. 

I wont go into too much detail but the things she says sometimes are genuinely terrifying.  this has made me decide to hide just about ***everything*** from her. I've gone through hell and I really do not need another super stressful life event coming to me again.  

yes I am non binary and aroace, but for the time being I have to play pretend and be cishet until I turn 18 and get the hell out of here. 

Basically, what im asking is for everyone to now not use masculine terms on me at all anymore. only feminine. including pronouns so only she/her, no neopronouns or he/him. 

being homeless is one of my worst fears honestly. I don't want to take any chances of  my mom kicking me out. 

I mean? its not too bad and ill be okay. I've never come out to anyone irl and always have she/ her used on me everyday. It could be worse.

along with that, I will also be wiping off a ton of information about me from my profiles and especially rentries. including my age & diagnoses as I don't think my mom would like that on here either. 

I don't even know anymore. I just want to live and get through this. 

great pride month this year!!!
