I used to be in this close group with two friends. 

Leia, Lockhart, and I. Three together, united like no other.

Extreamly, extreamly close. Closer than anyone else. The only people who I would entrust with my life and soul without hesitation. We met so long ago, when I was 12? That would make it around 4 years ago. 

I loved them. 

Which is why it pains me to even think about how I left them all behind. I cut off all contact, and ran off. Didn't look back even once. Lockhart had traced down my neospring (similar to retrospring, taken down a few weeks ago however...) and sent me a message saying that they would wait for me. I crashed out and went batshit crazy.

Before leaving though, I sent a pastebin link telling them that I would treasure the memories we created, but the chance of me coming back was heavily low. So, so low. 

But, *why*?

I just don't feel like I can tell them anything. And the conflict with my involvement in rentry was driving me insane. Leia told me that I should leave due to toxicity- but I wanted to stay because discords revolviong around rentry urls/decoration let me talk to people about my newest interest, website decoration and designing. At the same time, that feels so hypocritical? But it wasn't me...

Not for a second do I ever feel like myself. 

I just can't bring myself to tell my friends that truth. The full truth, I can't even tell to this blog until I truly find out.

I truly dont think I'll turn back. But, a few hours before I cut all contact, I archived every single discord server besides 2 or 3 that were lost forever via discrub. I think thats the name? Sorry if it's wrong. 

These servers, they're something. When I was younger I was heavily into roleplaying as fantasy characters in fantasy worlds, and so were Leia and Lockhart. These servers held countless dialogue and actions of these worlds. 

The official name I've given to these worlds is the *Polaris System.* The system I can write an entire blog post about- but I've archived it all. To see again through a different lens of what I did.

I'm such a vile writer... but was it really *my* writing? Anyway. I have so many dead original characters. So sorry to the 10 bajillion
