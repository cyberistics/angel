so! second day of github page code. I think I'm doing decent...?

I've decided to (technically) make this into a little blog for myself. Bearblog is interesting & super fun to use, but I really want to make my own sites. It'll be difficult, especially since I haver 0 ways of spending money (no fancy domain for me :( ) but I'm still doing it. I may be insane but who cares.

Do I have any idea what I'm doing? Not a single bit. Do I care? No. 

I like to think that whenever im working on this site, im just pulling and connecting at a bunch of wires frantically tryiing to make something work. That is genuinely how it feels.
