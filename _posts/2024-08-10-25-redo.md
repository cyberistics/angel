I give up.

My mom doesn't care about me and my dad doesn't care about me. I have chosen to just stay here, and forget about it all.

Will I loose my shit as soon as the first day of school rolls around? absolutley. But I've come to a point where I actually have nowhere to run. 

also i opened up to my mom via flip phone emails about my eating disorder and she hit me with the "oh that doesnt exist" YOUR CHILD HAS NEVER ATE NORMALLY FOR ONE SINGLE DAY? DOES A DOCTOR NEED TO TELL YOU THAT?

oh brother okay whatever umm. so besides rentry not working, pinterest does! springlove and tetratto do too. also fluffle.cc which is very similar to rentry. technically i could use that as a replacement for rentry and use my 3ds to copy and paste everything from fluffle to rentry. I don't have any good fluffle urls because of the insane hoarding but i dont think ill need very many in the first place.

i think ill live. and maybe get my laptop back soon.
