who up visual noveling. sorry.

For my digital media class, I was told that our final would be a combination of several projects. One stood out, a project where we could either:

1) make a song
2) make a video
or,
3) make a game

hell yeah. I saw that third option and went straight to google to do research. At first I wanted to go and make an rpg game with rpg maker, but I can't really work on that since I'm using a school chromebook. But, visual novels are an option, right?

I've been interested in visual novels since actually the start of time. I do actually have a batshit crazy hyperfixation on one, I don't talk about it (or at least as much as I did when I was like 13) anymore but it's still out there. Never played the games I was obbsessed with due to storage space; though I was addicted to reading game translations and watching gameplay on youtube.

Considering that I am on a school monitored chromebook and the fact it's just a high school final, I don't plan on doing anything that big. Basic theme, kind of badly drawn sprites, and around 10 minutes worth of gameplay. Doing an entire visual novel for a *high school final* is kind of crazy but yolo. Making a visual novel as an actual project and all sounds nice, maybe I'll make one after. Yes, this visual novel is on github pages. [Play it if you want it's pretty bad though.](https://cyberistics.github.io/decode/)

Nobody is doing this highschool final tryhard shit more then me.
