I did it. I told my mom and my dad that I would stay, and everything is settled. They recorded my response like 5 times too ijbol 

It does feel nice to have it all finally go away. For the dust to all settle after around 3 months of exhaustion and pain. Also, huge news!

**MY LAPTOP IS BACK.**

yes, yes its back. I have a (pretty strict) 2 hour limit only, but it feels great. First thing I did was play some roblox arsenal and check every single website I'm on. 

Laptop aside... I also went to picture day for school today. I dressed up nice and found one of my friends. The same friend I've mentioned here a few times, actually. It went well though, and I got all the classes I asked for. I also went shopping today! I got a few nice shirts and a new pair of black jeans. The one I usually wear has already faded to a grey color. The first day of school is tommorow, half of me can't wait, the other half is terrified. 

Well, at least I'm back home. Home is a strange word, I've never been in one household for longer then a year or two until I moved to my aunt's house. Even then, I go to my mom or dad during school breaks. 

One last peice of good news, I don't have that awful retail job anymore!!! i can sleep in until 6:30!!! yay!!!
