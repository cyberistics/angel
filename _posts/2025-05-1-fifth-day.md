I'm not sure what else to add. Since I'm using jekyll & the minima theme, i find it a little difficult to modify anything. If you know me, you'd know that I usually like to decorate my wesbites with several colors and graphics. Minimalism is nice every once in a while, though.

I do want to enable the dark theme for minima but I have 0 idea how. I was extremly busy yesterday, I've had zero time to contact anyone and ask if they know it's possible to add custom css / theme changes when using a static site generator (Is that the right word? Someone told me it's what Jekyll is.)

Maybe tommorow? I'll see. For today, I'll take a break and spend my time talking to my friends online and finishing more schoolwork.
