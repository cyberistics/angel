I HATE VISUAL NOVELS. I ALSO REALLY HATE MR BEAST. 

ahahaha context: I got the stupid discord gambling mrbeast virus/scam. My best guess is that it's coming from this visual novel (which will not be named...) I tried pirating which gave me a trojan. a virus trojan btw do not come @ me

this is so funny because i literally searched up "trojan" right now on my school chromebook to see if I could find some solutions and it hit me with things that are probably going to get my bitchass called into the office right now. I am so smart

anyway, my laptop is pretty much fried. so I'm going to install Linux Mint! Cinnamon flavored! woohoo! I'd be much happier if I could do it now though. I don't have a spare usb drive at all (i've turned my room upside down trying to find a spare) so I'll need to buy an extra one. I hope that the virus just doesn't do something stupid like take my emails & other discord accounts... 

It's kind of a lot to hope for now that I realize I'm going to leave my laptop behind for 4-ish days. I logged out of everything last time I used my laptop. Hopefully it doesnt get bricked? I think that's my main fear with this. 

I'm not a stranger to linux, I believe I used it some time when I was 13? My memory is fuzzy but I do remember some bits and pieces of it.
