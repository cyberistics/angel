Penny for your thoughts?

I just got myself this fancy bluetooth keyboard today. Some store nearby had this crazy sale going on, I was eyeing this "aesthetic" foldable pink keyboard for a while. It's like $35, but because of the sale, it was marked down to $20. I usually hate buying expensive things, but I couldn't miss such a good deal. My mom was feeling generous today anyway and spent like 3x that amount on my little sister. It also came with a matching pink bluetooth mouse! It's laughably small compared to my hands but i don't mind.

The keyboard itself works surprisingly well and fits perfectly into my purse. Woohoo! I am a fan of pink too, light pink has been one of my favorite colors since birth. Despite the rather masculine appearence I have in reality, I'm very feminine. One of the earliest pictures I have seen of myself is me in an oversized pink onesie with a pink bow in my hair.

Speaking of being feminine, I saw some skirts as well while shopping. I think skirts are pretty! It's such a shame I just can't wear them.
