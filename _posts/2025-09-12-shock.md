I am insanely jittery and I also just did a presentation in class and i am 90% sure my friend is looking at my screen rn and my earbuds are low on battery and i actually feel like pure death wow

I want to eat a whole tub of chookie dough ice cream this day is not for me. i have like 2 other presentations to do today and i have to get a strawpage url and i have like 8 rentry trade requests to respond to I AM DEADDDDDDDDDDDD. and i have to do my daily socializing because i made this big plan thing to become better with socializing which is actually going well? I don't know. I am in extreame pain and i have bad apple playing at full volume through my earbuds.
