LIKE I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONE...?

im like actually on the verge of falling asleep right now because i barely slept last night i was too busy playing princess debut on my ds. wow. I am insanely jittery and I also just did a presentation in class and i am 90% sure my friend is looking at my screen rn and my earbuds are low on battery and i actually feel like pure death wow

I NEED A REDBULL SO BAD MY STOMACH HURTS

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

I want to eat a whole tub of chookie dough ice cream this day is not for me. i have like 2 other presentations to do today and i have to get a strawpage url and i have like 8 rentry trade requests to respond to I AM DEADDDDDDDDDDDD. and i have to do my daily socializing because i made this big plan thing to become better with socializing which is actually going well? I don't know. I am in extreame pain and i have bad apple playing at full volume through my earbuds.

fastforward a few hours to now where im editing this blog page to add some more! also i just want a place to scream and cry for now. 

i got "cancelled" on a website LMFAOOOOO oh this is halarious, especially the reasoning. the reason is that aparently im selfish and greedy and begged people for urls... since when? I recieved a bunch of urls from a close friend who didnt mind and just told me i could have them if i used them (and i did!) and thats kind of all i can think of relating to this. deep thinking blog post soon later because this is silly actually. fyi these people have 90x more urls than i do hmm. 

im not going to lie though when people started screenshotting and digging through my profiles online its like *really strange?* like i get creeeped out why are you doing all this detective work on some raiden shogun obbsessor online lol. go work for the fbi and get off my profiles! if they find this blog however i will go batshit insane. i dont think nobody's actually been interested in my github thing but ummmmmmm you never know

wow i am truly god's most strongest soldier. also none of this feels real at all. am i really here? 

shoutout to the one (1) person who actually agreed and told me I was right. I love you please never die. I actually want to ask if they want like a free url or something because i genuinely appreciate the fact that someone stood up and decided to give me a bit of comfort, it made me feel so much better.

i swear to god i am genuinely in so much pain. god should've made me a guy. actually no i really cant imagine that... i take it back but wow i really feel like im going to pass out from the pain of cramps any time soon. also im praying blood doesnt get on my pants ummm

i want to go home so bad and take a long, long nap. and also I want to eat some cookie dough ice cream. this day feels like one really long fever dream

okay! editing this blog post hello again from 5 hours after this was last updated. today actually BECAME BETTER?

I gave the person who defended me a free url! it was one that was originally in a trade with the same person, but I (stupidly) withdrew last second because I was unsure. But now? I think the url is best used in the hands of a kind person who has helped me tremendously. Even if it was only one comment, a few words, I appriciate it so much. 

Surprisingly a bit after lunch ended (didnt even get food because of how naseous and nervous I was) my day became a LOT more better. In my pre-calculus class, we were put into teams and played a game practiciing questions for points. I surprisingly carried my team really hard and won??? Have no idea what happened I was just mashing numbers in my calculator and doing a ton of equasions. I also pointed out like 3 mistakes that our teacher made while writing out the answers LOL. I had the girls in my class cheer me on while I submitted my answers, so that made me feel great!

Also for my last presentation of the day I didnt even do anything... someone else just said the things on our slide. It was halarious actually, our teacher chose who would go first with some duck race website. It was literally a website where you named these ducks and they'd go in a race. AND WE GOT FIRST LMAOOOOO. Love how my teacher named one of the ducks "unneccarily large group" to represent a group with like 10 girls. It made me giggle super hard. I also talked a lot to my ex and my friends! I laughed a lot in this class period, especially with how much free time I had to just joke around and catch up on a few assignments. 

Going home I didnt have any chores to do, so I could just go play video games. Or thats at least what I would usually do. Instead, I caught up to my friend which i mentioned at the start of this blog. I'm so glad I got to find him again after 3 years. I mean, three years... that's a lot of time. Yet it feels like I last talked to him only a few days ago, but that's probably just my bad sense of time. Awful sense of time actually. There are times where years feel like days and days feel like years. 

But anyway, we talked about a lot! Visual novels, characters we liked, favorite foods, etc. He surprisingly likes his coffee black (meanwhile I like mine with lots of sugar and creamer) and he works as a nurse now! I find it admirable, taking care of people in need. 

I find it funny, he told me that I'm similar to KAngel from Needy Streamer Overload. Which, yeah! kind of! I used to relate to her pretty heavily at the end of last year when I experienced hallucinations & paranoia oddly similar to the one KAngel gets in the internet overdose ending. Doorbell ringing, knocking, all that. This internet stuff gets serious!

I've gotten a lot of attention in one day. it feels draining and i am exhausted.
