there's worse that happened but i cant be telling because i know this school is spying on me...

i am 2 seconds away from throwing up because my stomach hurts and i am DYING. but I cant take tylenol as a pain killer because I also need dayquil because im sick and i am done for

i actually find it so funny on how much god loves to throw the worst things at me. its like oh yay im fine for once and 2 days later im back in the pits of HELL

LIKE I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD...?

im like actually on the verge of falling asleep right now because i barely slept last night i was too busy playing princess debut on my ds. wow. I am insanely jittery and I also just did a presentation in class and i am 90% sure my friend is looking at my screen rn and my earbuds are low on battery and i actually feel like pure death wow

I NEED A REDBULL SO BAD MY STOMACH HURTS

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

I want to eat a whole tub of chookie dough ice cream this day is not for me. i have like 2 other presentations to do today and i have to get a strawpage url and i have like 8 rentry trade requests to respond to I AM DEADDDDDDDDDDDD. and i have to do my daily socializing because i made this big plan thing to become better with socializing which is actually going well? I don't know. I am in extreame pain and i have bad apple playing at full volume through my earbuds.

fastforward a few hours to now where im editing this blog page to add some more! also i just want a place to scream and cry for now. 

i got "cancelled" on a website LMFAOOOOO oh this is halarious, especially the reasoning. the reason is that aparently im selfish and greedy and begged people for urls... since when? I recieved a bunch of urls from a close friend who didnt mind and just told me i could have them if i used them (and i did!) and thats kind of all i can think of relating to this. deep thinking blog post soon later because this is silly actually. fyi these people have 90x more urls than i do hmm. 

im not going to lie though when people started screenshotting and digging through my profiles online its like *really strange?* like i get creeeped out why are you doing all this detective work on some raiden shogun obbsessor online lol. go work for the fbi and get off my profiles! if they find this blog however i will promply go batshit insane. i dont think nobody's actually been interested in my github thing but ummmmmmm you never know

wow i am truly god's most strongest soldier. also none of this feels real at all. am i really here? 

shoutout to the one (1) person who actually agreed and told me I was right. I love you please never die. I actually want to ask if they want like a free url or something because i genuinely appreciate the fact that someone stood up and decided to give me a bit of comfort, it made me feel so much better.

i swear to god i am genuinely in so much pain. god should've made me a guy. actually no i really cant imagine that... i take it back but wow i really feel like im going to pass out from the pain of cramps any time soon. also im praying blood doesnt get on my pants ummm

i want to go home so bad and take a long, long nap. and also I want to eat some cookie dough ice cream. this day feels like one really long fever dream.
