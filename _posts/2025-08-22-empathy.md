he may have not died himself but i am glad that karma got his ass. thank you god for this blessing! hooray we all cheered and clapped and smiled actually

ahhh so glad. you can diss me for being awful about this but i do NOT care. I have zero empathy for that guy including anyone he's related to. hence the title! the amount of trauma ive been left with after all of that is enough to leave me absolutley wanting the worst for him. 

I also confronted my friend (same exact one ive mentioned like a dozen times already) about them following said guy on instagram. Am I stalking my friend? well no. I made an instagram account once for a school club thing and there was this fun little bar saying "people (friend's name) are friended" or something similar. and boom! his name! wow. 

They were extreamly sorry so I forgave them. Woohoo! 

yeah anyway i got nothing else to say. yay
