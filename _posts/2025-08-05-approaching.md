I'm really, really running out of time. 

Two more days left, I have to leave on the 8th. There has been zero communication with my aunt, uncle, cousins, or father. I have no idea what to expect or what to do.

I need to go to a different school. I won't get anything done if I keep going to the same place that hurts me. Im also desperate to get my laptop back.

Not really sure what to do. I haven't slept right since the start of the month, my head hurts. 

I really want to just live by myself. I don't need or want my family. I can find a job easily and im good with money. Having my own place would be a dream; but I'm not sure about it coming true.

I'll figure everything out soon... There will soon be a day where I will be happy and never look back.

On that dream note maybe it could work? Apartments up in Vegas probably aren't cheap but my dad could afford it. If he really just doesn't want me there with him, why not just in a different place? I know I can buy second-hand furniture and thrift clothes. If not a job in-person, I could totally try for a job online.

I'll live.
