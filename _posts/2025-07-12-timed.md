The call came. Or so I assume as I only eavesdropped, but I heard a good portion of it. Anytime now, my dad will come and send me back.

I'm kind of doomed. They talked about getting be a therapist or counselor. I mean, seriously? After I tell you guys that I was trapped in a counselors office they're sending me back to one.

Please let me live.
