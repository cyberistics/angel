For this day, I'm going to take a break. I am content for today with my code. 

I want to try and use the dark minima mode for this theme, I put "skin:dark" in my yaml file, yet nothing happens. I think I'll have to ask someone who knows.. I'll do it tommorow though.

Today I need to catch up on a lot of my schoolwork. I am still a high-school student after all, and my studies are supposed to be my main priority. I'm swamped in all my classes, I need to clear out the piles of paper and several emails. I find myself so busy everyday. It's always school, coding, 3d modeling, graphic designing, or (attempting) to socialize. 

I got 4 hours of sleep today and coffee isn't helping me. It does make me more focused and more calm at least.
